Install with npm:

```bash
npm install -g @volcano.dev/cli
volcano --help
```

Or install with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g @volcano.dev/cli
volcano --help
```

Or install with Bun:

```bash
bun add -g @volcano.dev/cli
volcano --help
```

Or install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install Kong/volcano/volcano
volcano --help
```

Or install manually:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.volcano.dev/builds/install.sh | sh
volcano --help
```

To install the CLI and set up Volcano in detected coding agents:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.volcano.dev/builds/install.sh | sh -s -- --setup
```

The script requires `cosign` to verify the release signature. To select a specific
version, set `VOLCANO_VERSION` when running the installer. This example pins the
current release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.volcano.dev/builds/install.sh -o install-volcano.sh
VOLCANO_VERSION="$(curl -fsSL https://download.volcano.dev/builds/releases/latest-version)" sh install-volcano.sh
```

The install script, the latest-version lookup, and the CLI and signature
downloads all use `download.volcano.dev`, and `cosign` can also contact Sigstore
for trust metadata. On a network that allows GitHub but not
`download.volcano.dev`, fetch the script from
`https://github.com/Kong/volcano-cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh` and set
`VOLCANO_GITHUB_RELEASES_URL=https://github.com/Kong/volcano-cli/releases`.
Versions released before Volcano downloads are only on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kong/volcano-cli/releases); to install one
with `VOLCANO_VERSION`, also set `VOLCANO_GITHUB_RELEASES_URL` to that URL.

## Upgrading

`volcano upgrade` upgrades the CLI the same way it was installed: it delegates
to the package manager it came from (`npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn`/`bun install -g`, or
`brew upgrade`) and only replaces the binary in place for the manual
install.sh method. If the package manager isn't on your `PATH`, it prints the
command to run instead. The install method is recorded at install time (with a
fallback to the binary's path), so no configuration is needed.

The npm package is a thin wrapper: its `postinstall` step downloads the
platform-specific binary from Volcano downloads and verifies it
against that release's `SHA256SUMS`. Set `VOLCANO_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` to skip the
download; the binary is fetched on first run instead.

If pnpm reports `ERR_PNPM_NO_GLOBAL_BIN_DIR`, run `pnpm setup`, restart your
shell, and retry the install.
