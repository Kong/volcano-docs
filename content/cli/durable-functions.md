## What it is

A durable function checkpoints its progress and resumes from the last completed
step, so one execution can run for hours instead of the seconds a normal
invocation allows. Use one for work that has to survive a restart: a multi-step
order pipeline, a long agent run, a nightly batch that calls out to a slow API.

Durable functions are cloud-only, run on the runtimes that ship the durable
authoring API (JavaScript, TypeScript and Python), and are a separate collection
from standard functions:

- You **start** an execution instead of invoking a function. The start returns a
  handle immediately; the result arrives later.
- Each **execution** is a resource with its own id, status, and result.
- The two collections never accept each other's names or ids. A function's kind
  is fixed when it is created.

## How it relates

- Belongs to a **project**, and reads **variables**, **databases**, and
  **storage** in that project like any function.
- Its sources live in `volcano/functions/` beside standard ones. Only
  `volcano-config.yaml` says which are durable, so `volcano functions deploy
  --all` skips them and `volcano cloud durable deploy --all` picks them up.
  `-f` deploys one the manifest does not mention, and refuses a name the
  manifest declares standard — a kind cannot be changed once the function
  exists.
- Every region the project deploys to has to offer durable execution, or the
  deploy is refused up front.
- Durable execution needs the durable authoring API. A source is deployed on the
  newest runtime for its language that ships one, which is not always that
  language's default — a Python durable function needs a newer runtime than a
  standard one gets. A language that has no such runtime at all is refused
  before anything is uploaded.

```yaml
version: 1
project:
  name: my-app
functions:
  - name: hello
  - name: order-pipeline
    kind: durable
```

A durable entry takes `variable_scope` and `variables` like any other, and
`durable deploy` sends what the manifest declares. Declaring nothing leaves an
existing function's scope alone.

## CLI operations

| Operation | Command |
|---|---|
| Deploy all declared, or one | `volcano cloud durable deploy --all \| -f <name\|path>`; `--public`/`--private` take `-f` |
| List | `volcano cloud durable list [--page 1] [--limit 100]` |
| Get | `volcano cloud durable get <name-or-id>` |
| Delete | `volcano cloud durable delete <name-or-id> [--yes]` |
| Logs | `volcano cloud durable logs <name-or-id> --type build\|runtime [--follow] [--limit 100]` |
| Start an execution | `volcano cloud durable start <function> [--input …] [--name …]` |
| List executions | `volcano cloud durable executions list <function> [--status …] [--page 1] [--limit 100]` |
| Get one execution | `volcano cloud durable executions get <function> <execution-id>` |
| Stop an execution | `volcano cloud durable executions stop <function> <execution-id> [--yes]` |
| Schedule executions | `volcano cloud durable schedulers create <function> --cron "0 * * * *" [--name …] [--input …] [--regions …]` |
| List schedulers | `volcano cloud durable schedulers list <function>` |
| Pause or resume one | `volcano cloud durable schedulers disable\|enable <function> <scheduler-id>` |
| Delete one | `volcano cloud durable schedulers delete <function> <scheduler-id> [--yes]` |

Wherever a command takes a function, it takes the name or the id. `deploy` needs
exactly one of `--all` and `-f`. `--yes` skips the confirmation prompt the three
destructive commands ask for. Schedulers are a Pro capability, capped at 5 per
project across standard and durable functions together; a create beyond that
answers `403`.

All of them run under `volcano cloud`. Local development does not run durable
executions and the local server refuses to create a durable function rather than
pretending to, so a bare `volcano durable …` answers with that refusal rather
than running anything.

## Examples

```bash
# Deploy every function volcano-config.yaml declares durable
volcano cloud durable deploy --all

# Deploy one, and let anon keys start it
volcano cloud durable deploy -f order-pipeline --public

# Start an execution and follow it
volcano cloud durable start order-pipeline --input '{"order_id":4417}'
volcano cloud durable executions get order-pipeline 66666666-6666-4666-8666-666666666666

# Only the executions still running
volcano cloud durable executions list order-pipeline --status running

# End one where it is
volcano cloud durable executions stop order-pipeline 66666666-6666-4666-8666-666666666666
```

`--status` takes the status as the API spells it: `pending`, `running`,
`succeeded`, `failed`, `timed_out`, `stopped` or `unknown`. The dashboard labels
those for reading, so a `pending` execution appears there as "Starting".

`unknown` is terminal, like the four outcomes before it: the platform could not
establish how the execution ended, so it carries no result and nothing will
settle it later. Retry it under the same name, which picks that execution back
up rather than starting a second one.

## Logs

`durable logs` reads the same two log streams the standard collection has, on a
durable function:

```bash
# Why the deploy ended in "failed"
volcano cloud durable logs order-pipeline --type build

# What the function logged while its executions ran
volcano cloud durable logs order-pipeline --type runtime --follow
```

`--type build` reads the deployment the function is on, which is the one that
just failed. `--type runtime` spans every execution, including every resume: the
code between context operations runs again each time, so a line logged there
appears once per resume while a line inside a completed `step` does not.

`--follow` works on both, and stops at a different point for each: following
build logs ends when the deploy does, following runtime logs runs until you
interrupt it. A function that has never deployed has no build logs, and
`--type build` says so rather than printing nothing.

`volcano cloud functions logs` does not accept a durable function's name: the
two collections never accept each other's names or ids.

## Scheduling executions

A scheduler ticks on a cron expression and starts an execution instead of
invoking the function, so every tick produces an execution you can list, follow,
and stop like any other:

```bash
# Start one execution an hour, with the same input each time
volcano cloud durable schedulers create order-pipeline --cron "0 * * * *" --input '{"scope":"hourly"}'

volcano cloud durable schedulers list order-pipeline
volcano cloud durable executions list order-pipeline
```

Each tick names its execution after the run, so a tick Volcano has to retry
resolves to the execution it already started rather than beginning a second one.
Ticks draw on the same durable execution and operation allowances and the same
concurrency cap a manual start does; a tick that would exceed the cap fails that
run rather than queueing.

`schedulers disable` stops the ticks and leaves the scheduler in place;
executions it already started keep running. `schedulers delete` removes the
scheduler and its run history, and also leaves running executions alone — stop
those with `executions stop`.

## Starting is asynchronous

`start` returns as soon as the execution is accepted, with the execution's id
and name. Read the execution to get its status and, once it has finished, its
result:

```bash
volcano cloud durable start order-pipeline --input order.json --name order-4417
volcano cloud durable executions get order-pipeline <execution-id>
```

`--input` takes an inline JSON object or the path to a file holding one, and is
handed to the function verbatim. Omit it to start with no input at all, which is
not the same as starting with `{}` — and not the same as `--input null`, which
is refused, because it would arrive as neither.

`--name` is the execution's idempotency key. Starting again under a name that
already names an execution returns the existing one instead of beginning a
second, and is not charged again — so a retried start is safe. Omit it and
Volcano generates one. A name is letters, digits, `-`, `_` and `.`, up to 255
characters; anything else is refused.

A deploy finishes asynchronously, so a start that follows one straight away can
be refused while the function is still provisioning. Wait for `get` to report
`active` and start again.

## Visibility

`--public` lets a project's anon key start executions of one function;
`--private` takes that back. A public durable function is still not invocable
over HTTP the way a public standard function is — starting an execution is the
only thing the anon key can do. Polling and stopping always need a
project-scoped credential.

Omit both flags and a redeploy keeps the visibility the function already has. A
new durable function starts private.

Neither flag is accepted with `--all`. Visibility is a per-function decision and
a durable function has no update endpoint, so one flag applied to a whole
manifest would take a redeploy of every function to undo. Deploy the one you
want to change with `-f`.

## Stopping and deleting

`executions stop` requests the end of one execution. Cancellation happens
behind the request, so the execution it prints back often still reads `running`;
`executions get` is how you watch it reach `stopped`. Steps already completed
are not undone. Stopping one that has already finished reports the state it is
in rather than failing.

`durable delete` tears down the function and its execution history. It does not
wait for work in flight, so stop an execution you need ended first.
